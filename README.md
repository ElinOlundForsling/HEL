# HEL: A Smarthome prototype

HEL is a prototype of smart home system I’m working on, aptly named to avoid copyright claims. (Thou the ultimate goal is to buy one of these bad boys(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaINyYJ47NY), hook it up to a raspberry pi and then python together an AI for it - a project a bit on the backburner until my Javascript portfolio is looking snazzier). Right now, it uses Google Speech API, and can successfully turn off and on any of the lamp groups in my home. It’s not configured to be used in other homes, although that functionality could easily be added. To connect with the lights, it uses the Philips Hue API through Peter Murray’s amazing liberary (https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api).

Anyway, hope something about it tickles your fancy and if so, see you in space!
